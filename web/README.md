# CleanIT Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend scaffold for the CleanIT project.

Quick start:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server (default http://localhost:5173).
- `npm run build` builds the production bundle into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
